My research career began in high school through Kentucky's dual-credit STEM magnet school at Western Kentucky University. Dr. Claire Rinehartâ€™s bioinformatics course not only introduced me to the subject, but profoundly shaped my impression of research as a whole. I learned through bioinformatics, which demanded both biology knowledge and computer savvy, that my strongest skills could be integrated within a single discipline. I navigated databases, worked with different kinds of biological data, improved my programming skills, and annotated a section of a viral genome. One semester was not enough; I continued working with Dr. Rinehart for the remainder of my time at WKU, this time on analyzing phage geographic distribution, research I presented at the UT-ORNL- KBRIN Bioinformatics Summit.
