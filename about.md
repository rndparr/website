I am a research specialist at <a href="https://yanglab-emory.github.io/">YangLab</a>. 
an <a href="https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html">biostatistics</a>
 MSPH student at the <a href="https://www.sph.emory.edu">Rollins School of Public Health</a>
 and a research assistant <a href="https://yanglab-emory.github.io/">YangLab</a>.<br><br>

I joined <a href="https://yanglab-emory.github.io/">YangLab</a> February of 2020

excited to start working on the new <a href="https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/rsph-hpc/">RSPH HPC</a>.

My research career began in high school through the <a href="https://www.wku.edu/academy/">Gatton Academy</a>, Kentucky's dual-credit STEM magnet school at Western Kentucky University, where Dr. Claire Rinehart’s bioinformatics course not only introduced me to the subject, but profoundly shaped my impression of research as a whole. I continued working with Dr. Rinehart for the remainder of my time at WKU, this time on analyzing phage geographic distribution, research I presented at the UT-ORNL-KBRIN Bioinformatics Summit.


I <a href="https://wkunews.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/gatton-graduation-2013/">graduated from Gatton</a> in 2013. Still undecided on my future career after graduating, briefly considered engineering until temporary health issues forced me to withdraw from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. During my time away from 


the experience was valuable for understanding EHR

I decided to reconsidered my "I don't want to go into medicine" stance and worked as an emergency room scribe 



I thought I had the best job of anyone there because I didn't have to touch anything gross, confirming that medicine was not something for me to aspire to.


I enrolled part-time at the local University of Louisville.

while i appreciate the practical knowledge

i concluded that medicine was not something for me to aspire to given I thought I had the best job there since I didn't have to touch anything gross.



graduated from the University of Louisville with a BS in Biology and a BA in Mathematics.



My research career began in high school through Kentucky's dual-credit STEM magnet school at Western Kentucky University. Dr. Claire Rinehart’s bioinformatics course not only introduced me to the subject, but profoundly shaped my impression of research as a whole. I learned through bioinformatics, which demanded both biology knowledge and computer savvy, that my strongest skills could be integrated within a single discipline. I navigated databases, worked with different kinds of biological data, improved my programming skills, and annotated a section of a viral genome. One semester was not enough; I continued working with Dr. Rinehart for the remainder of my time at WKU, this time on analyzing phage geographic distribution, research I presented at the UT-ORNL-KBRIN Bioinformatics Summit.


which is a no-go on a quarter system. 


maybe I should reconsider medicine again? scribing. Okay. Confirmed: Nope.
